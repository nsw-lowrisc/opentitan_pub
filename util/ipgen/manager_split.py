"""Support functions for the templates of the split clock and reset managers.

Each manager is split into a primary partition and a secondary partition. The configuration of the
top says what each partition hosts, and topgen puts this into the ipconfig:

 - clkmgr: the partition that has a source clock in its clock_srcs receives it
   (src_clks[...]['clkmgr_partition']). That partition hosts the clocks of the source.
 - rstmgr: a partition that receives the clock of a reset in its clock_srcs generates the reset. If
   the partition in the reset's power domain receives the clock, that partition generates the reset
   (output_rsts[...]['partition'], by power domain). The secondary partition hosts the roots of the
   reset tree.

The functions here apply that data. They also define the layout of the output structs, so that the
templates and topgen agree on it.

The two managers handle clocks and resets in the same way:

 - A partition generates what it receives the clock for (clock_srcs).
 - A partition outputs what its power domain uses.
 - What the other domain needs crosses once, in intraip_s2p or intraip_p2s.
 - The primary partition outputs all the clock gating and reset asserted indications, for the
   alert handlers.

The remaining differences have these causes:

 - Resets have power-domain variants. A reset is generated, routed and output per reset and power
   domain. Its field is an array over the power domains or a single bit (rstmgr_is_array), and a
   shadowed reset has a twin. A clock is a single signal.
 - Clocks share nets. All the root-gated clocks of a source are its root clock, and the feed-through
   clocks are buffers of the source. So the clkmgr routes nets (clkmgr_routed_nets), while the
   rstmgr routes single bits.
 - The templates differ in structure. The primary partition of the clkmgr makes the derived clocks
   (the dividers). The secondary partition of the rstmgr hosts the roots of the reset tree (the POR
   handling). So the secondary partition of the rstmgr always has the always-on clock. Its clock
   ports are the clocks of the resets that it generates (rstmgr_clocks), while the clock ports of
   the clkmgr are its source clocks.
 - topgen already resolved clock connections during merge and reset connections later, in the
   templates. So merge records the consumers of a clock (ClockSignal.add_endpoint), while
   lib._rstmgr_consumers collects the consumers of a reset from the modules afterwards. topgen
   builds the clock paths from the source (lib.get_clock_prefixes) and the reset paths from the
   partition (lib.get_reset_prefixes).
 - topgen already built the clkmgr parameters in ipgen/clkmgr_gen.py and the rstmgr parameters in
   topgen.py. So the partition data enters each ipconfig there.
